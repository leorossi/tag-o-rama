# Tag-O-Rama

A wordpress plugin that will generate 100 posts with random tags and will show the tags distribution in a chart using [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).

Note that this is an assessment project, so this plugin is not useful **at all**.

## Installation

```
cd /path/to/plugin
composter install
```

Then activate the plugin from your plugin page. That's it.
